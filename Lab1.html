<h2>What's this about?</h2>
<p> The 24 hours of Daytona, one of the Crown Jewels of endurance racing alongside the Lemans 24, is upon us. Join us as
  we do our best to stay awake and watch the whole 24 hour race, and the riveting battles that happen during it!
</p>
<h2>What's the night gonna look like?</h2>
<p>
We will meet in the McCormick lounge (floor 5) on Januar 25th at 12:40pm. This is 1 hour before the 24, so we'll be able
to setup and talk for a bit before the race starts! There will be Pizza, Soda, and Chips, but feel free to bring your own snack items! 
Just make sure that they're allergy friendly. 
</p>
<h3>What to wear</h3>
<p>
  Literally anything you want. I'm gonna show up in pajamas.
